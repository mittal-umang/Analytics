# Chapter 2 Question 6
# Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and
# 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the
# sum of all its digits is 14.

# ## this code can work for any number of digits. limiting the values through user input as asked in question.

    while number > 0:
        sumofDigits += number % 10
